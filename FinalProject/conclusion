We have discovered that:
  1.Generally the unemployment rates have decreased from 2010 to 2019.
    [The unemployment rate plot can show the trend]
  2.The percentage of employment change has increased
  3.The field services have the highest proportion of employers.

The broaden implication:
  As the unemployment rates have decreased from 2010 to 2019, it may continued 
to decrease but in a slower speed (The gradient of the unemployment rates line
becomes smaller).

Data quality:
  As our dataset was collected by the authority - Economic Research Service of
the United States Department of Agriculture.
  We think it gives us unbiased results as it uses the same method to collect
data in the same category from different places. However, we do not know why
there are some missed data for some places (e.g.Aleutian Island, Prince of Wales
-Outer Ketchikan, etc).

Future advice:
  It can label the blanked reason for those places that did not have data.
